The Released final product is in the "Releases". There are 3 sections:

Map Maker
NPC Maker
Runtime

In releases is a proper readme for module creation and usage.

The RPGRuntime, NPC Maker, and MapCreator source is available for perusal.

Miscellaneous files like the dummied-out audio system, inventory system, and a refactor of the old java RPG code is in Misc Files.
